## 🗂️ Kanban Task Board

## 📖 Project Description

The **Kanban Task Board** is a lightweight task management tool that mimics the workflow of popular apps like Trello.  
It provides a **visual layout of tasks** organized into columns, each representing a status (e.g., _Todo_, _Doing_, _Done_).  

Users can interact with task cards, view details in a modal, and update status through a dropdown menu.  

This project is built entirely with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize for learning or personal use.
